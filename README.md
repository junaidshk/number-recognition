# Number Recognition using ML & Image Processing.
Android App which uses an API to connect to a OpenCV &amp; ML model deployed on AWS, to predict the numbers captured in an image.
<br><br>
Two Directories : <br>
1. AWS_API<br>
2. Android_App
<br><br>
1. AWS_API<br>
Consists of ML model, Flask API, Image processing code files that are to be deployed on AWS.
<br><br>
2. Android_App<br>
Consists of android application source code which is configured to interact with the flask api deployed on AWS.
<br><br>
<b>Note</b>: If facing issue with configuring the android app, the we can check the working of ML model and image processing code directly using the process_image.py file. The file is setup for DEBUG purpose so it will show you all the stages of image processing.
I have provided test image, but you can use any image of your choice and name it as per the test image.
